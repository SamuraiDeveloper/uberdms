NOTICE
=======

THIS CODE IS NOW OBSOLETE.

SevenSpark has made an [official DMS section](http://www.pagelines.com/shop/sections/ubermenu-adapter/) available. I suggect you use that.



UberDMS
=======

UberDMS is a simple section to allow the placement of [Ubermenu](http://sevenspark.com/goods/ubermenu-responsive-mega-menu) within the [PageLines DMS](http://www.pagelines.com) system.

There are a number of methods to do this, including just using the [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) within a text section. However it seemed natural to have a "first class" citizen section to handle this. The code itself is very inspired by [the section code provided by Sevenspark themselves](http://sevenspark.com/docs/ubermenu-pagelines-dms).


Installation
------------

Genrally speaking, you want to grab the [RELEASE](https://github.com/SamuraiDeveloper/uberdms/tree/RELEASE) code if you are an end user.


### Simple RELEASE Installation

* [download the release ZIP](https://github.com/SamuraiDeveloper/uberdms/archive/RELEASE.zip)
* rename the file to "uberdms.zip" from "uberdms-RELEASE.zip"
* upload and install to [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) like any other plugin


Next Steps
