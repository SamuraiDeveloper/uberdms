THIS CODE IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED AT THIS REPOSITORY. IT WILL BE REMOVED ENTIRELY SOON WHEN THE SECTION IS MADE FREELY AVAILABLE THROUGH OTHER MEANS.



UberDMS
=======

UberDMS is a simple section to allow the placement of [Ubermenu](http://sevenspark.com/goods/ubermenu-responsive-mega-menu) within the [PageLines DMS](http://www.pagelines.com) system.

There are a number of methods to do this, including just using the [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) within a text section. However it seemed natural to have a "first class" citizen section to handle this. The code itself is very inspired by [the section code provided by Sevenspark themselves](http://sevenspark.com/docs/ubermenu-pagelines-dms).
